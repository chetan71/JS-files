Selection Sort:- (we find min value in every position then swap 
					after finding true min.)
	In selection sort, first we check min value
with every element and find min value from start to 
end, then that min value will get swap. As such, now
 that initial value is sorted. then we reduce the length 
 or we neglect swapped initial value & next value becomes
  initial. then this process continues until array gets sorted.

Bubble Sort:- (we find max value between 2 then swap immediately)
	In Bubble sort, we check initial value is greater then 
	next value. if TRUE, then its gets swapped else next value
	gets picked. then same happens next value gets checked is 
	it smaller than pervious(we can also change to smaller. But
	IMP point is Bigger value gets pushed back until it reach end.
	then end part become sorted and length is reduced & process 
	continues until array gets sorted.
